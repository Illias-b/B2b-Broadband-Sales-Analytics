# B2b-Broadband-Sales-Analytics

This repository showcases a project where legacy system data was combined with new data in the AmDocs database to create a tableau workbook for the propositions team to analyse business to business broadband sales.

This project aimed to provide insights into the performance of business to business broadband sales in different cities, with the goal of informing the propositions team's decision-making process regarding which campaigns to keep or take off the market. The project involved querying and creating a table in the legacy database, and transferring the data to the Snowflake data warehouse using Alteryx. The legacy data was then combined with the new world data in an Alteryx workflow, which was scheduled for daily updates.

To achieve the project's aims, a series of worksheets and a final dashboard were created using Tableau. These visualizations highlighted key metrics such as sales volumes, number of tariffs sold, and the most popular areas/cities. This allowed the propositions team to easily analyze and understand the performance of their broadband sales in different markets.

As the person who completed this project, I gained a strong understanding of data warehousing, data preparation, and data visualization using industry-standard tools such as Snowflake, Alteryx, and Tableau. I also developed skills in querying and manipulating legacy databases, as well as combining data from different sources to create a comprehensive picture of business performance. Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to deliver valuable insights to inform business decision-making using data analysis and visualization.
